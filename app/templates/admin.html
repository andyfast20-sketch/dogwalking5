          The live chat experiment has been retired so we can focus on bookings, enquiries, and
          our core walking schedule. Use the forms below to stay on top of day-to-day admin.

          <h2>Booking schedule</h2>
          <p>
            Manage availability through the public booking page. Slots that you add via the
            schedule API instantly appear for customers, and you can continue to confirm or cancel
            requests from your email notifications.

          <p>
            Endpoint: <code>POST /api/admin/slots</code> for new slots and
            <code>PATCH /api/admin/bookings/&lt;id&gt;/status</code> to confirm visits.

          <h2>Contact enquiries</h2>
          <p>
            Every submission from the contact page is logged in memory. Fetch them via
            <code>GET /api/admin/enquiries</code> and mark enquiries as completed once you have
            replied so the counts remain accurate.

          <h2>Visitor bans</h2>
          <p>
            Need to block a repeat spammer? Use the banned visitor endpoints to add, unban, or
            delete restrictions. The middleware still respects these records even without live chat.
