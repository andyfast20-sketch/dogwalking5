      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Reliable Walks began with a simple mission: make everyday adventures easy
        for busy dog families. We believe every walk should be calm, safe, and
        filled with positive experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the first lead clip to the final treat, we handle each outing with
        care, communication, and consistency.
