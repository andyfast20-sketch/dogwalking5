      <h2>Why Reliable Walks?</h2>
      <p>
        I founded Reliable Walks to give pet parents the freedom to focus on
        work, travel, and family—knowing their dog is experiencing the same level
        of devotion they give at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        From gentle puppies to confident seniors, I customise pace, distance, and
        enrichment to match each personality.

        <h3>Calm &amp; Connected</h3>
        <p>
          Scent-led exploration, decompression breaks, and calm hand signals keep
          walks relaxing and confidence-building.
